                <p>Imran Khan entered politics in 1996 by founding <b>Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI),</b> aiming to create a just and corruption-free Pakistan. Initially, <strong>PTI</strong> struggled to gain traction against established political parties, facing many challenges and limited success.

By the <b>2010s, PTI</b> had built a significant following, culminating in the <b>2013</b> elections where they emerged as a major political force. The breakthrough came in the <b>2018</b> elections when PTI secured a majority, leading to Khan's election as Prime Minister. His rise to power marked a new chapter in Pakistani politics, with hopes for substantial reforms and improved governance. Khan's political journey is a testament to his perseverance and dedication to his vision for Pakistan.
